    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole Masala is a popular Punjabi dish where chickpeas are simmered in a spicy & tangy gravy. "Chole" is a Punjabi word for "chickpeas" and "masala" is a word for "spices". So this dish is nothing but chickpeas cooked to perfection with various spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs</p>
    <p>Chickpea is a legume that is relished all over India. While the term Chole is specifically used to mention the Punjabi dish, Chana masala is a more generic word used to mention any spiced Indian Chickpea Curry. So Chole Masala is a Punjabi preparation and Chana Masala or a simple Indian Chickpea Curry is not necessarily Punjabi and is made in numerous ways across India.</p>
